    - Very little partial credit
    - Be able to do addition and subtraction on two decimal values in binary
    - Answer in binary and hexadecimal
    - Know two's compliment for signed negative values
    - Know how the flags are affected (OF, SF, ZF)
- Know the layout of memory in a running program
    - Know the name of the 5 sections of memory and what they hold
        - STACK
            - Stores local variables, return addresses, and data pushed to the stack stored during runtime
        - HEAP
            - Dynamic storage that is allocated during runtime.
        - BSS
            - Store unintialized data
        - DATA
            - Stores intialized data
        - TEXT
            - Stores instructions for the CPU to execute
- Know where and what a register is  
    -
- Know the instructions to assemble, link, and execute an asm file
    - nasm -f elf -g [filename]
    - ld -m elf_i386 -o [outputname] [filenames]
- Know the three operations of the CPU when running instructions
    - Name and a brief description
    - Fetch instruction 
    - Decode Instruction
    - Load Instruction
- Know the four general purpose registers
    - EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX
    - Know the common uses of the registers (implicit uses)
    - Uses of EDI, ESI, ESP, EBP
- Know how to move a smaller value into a larger registers
    - movzx
- Know what a label represents in text/data sections
    - Label is a constant value with equ
    - The size of the label is not kept with the label
    - When dereferencing an address, we can come up with another address with arithmetic (EX: [EBP + 8])
    - Know the LEA instruction and its use
- Know the string operations
    - SCAS, MOVS, LODS, STOS, 
    - Know what registers are involved in each

        - REPNZ
        - REPZ
- Know multiplication and division
    - MUL, DIV
    - Know how to prepare for signed extension
        - Three operations to extend into EDX for signed division
            - CBW (convert byte to word) extends AL into AH
            - CWD (convert word to doubleword) extends AX into DX
            - CDQ (convert doubleword to quadword) extends EAX into EDX
    - Know how EDX is affected for division and multiplication and know to zero out EDX for division
        - Remainder is put into EDX for division
        - Quotient is put into EDX for division
        - Multiplication will extend into EDX if larger than EAX
- Know the shift operations
    - Know the involvement of the carry flag in the operations
    - Know the arithmetic effect of the shift operations
        - SHL will multiply by two
        - SHR will integer divide by two
- Know which registers are preserved by the caller and which are reserved by the callee
    - Caller: EAX, ECX, EDX
    - Callee: EBX, EDI, ESI, EBP
- Know how to write a program with a flow control structure
    - Could be a if statement, while, do while, switch
- Know the file operations
    - Open, close, read, write
    - Access codes

- 2.5 hour coding exam
- 7:30 AM
