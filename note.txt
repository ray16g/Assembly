    - Know the name of the 5 sections of memory and what they hold
        - STACK
            - Stores local variables, return addresses, and data pushed to the stack stored during runtime
        - HEAP
            - Dynamic storage that is allocated during runtime.
        - BSS
            - Store unintialized data
        - DATA
            - Stores intialized data
        - TEXT
            - Stores instructions for the CPU to execute
- Know where and what a register is  
    -
- Know the instructions to assemble, link, and execute an asm file

        - Remainder is put into EDX for division
        - Quotient is put into EDX for division
        - Multiplication will extend into EDX if larger than EAX
